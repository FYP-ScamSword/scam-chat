## Instructions:
1. Create a `.env` file in the same folder as this `README.md` file.
2. Add your MongoDB connection string and port to the `.env` file.
The Mongo DB connection string is `mongodb://localhost:27017` by default if you are running the database on your localhost.

The port can be a port number of your choice. I have used 8081.
```
MONGODB_CONNECTION = ""
PORT=8081
```

## Pre-Installation:
1. Have NodeJS installed (Currently using v16.15.0)
2. `npm install`
3. If you are running MongoDB on your localhost, install the [MongoDB community server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

## To run:
1. Enter `npm run start`.
